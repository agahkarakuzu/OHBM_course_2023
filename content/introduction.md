### Introduction

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The human brain, a marvel of complexity and intricacy, has captivated the curiosity of scientists, researchers, and scholars across diverse disciplines for decades. Within the realm of neuroscience, a relatively recent but profoundly influential subfield has emerged: Whole-Brain Modeling (WBM). It's a field with a short history, yet its roots and conceptual foundations stretch back as far as the 1940s. However, it wasn't until the late 2000s that WBM took its current shape, closely intertwined with its sibling field, macro-connectomics.
The allure of WBM lies in its ambition—to understand and model the entirety of neural activity within the human brain. It seeks to unravel the intricate dance of neural patterns, a choreography orchestrated by anatomical connections, intrinsic neural dynamics, and external stimuli, including sensory inputs, cognitive processes, pharmacological influences, and electromagnetic forces.
Why does this holistic view of the brain matter? There are two compelling reasons. Firstly, it allows us to study the brain as a unified, functioning entity rather than a collection of disparate regions. Secondly, it leverages noninvasive neuroimaging and related methods to glean insights from the brains of healthy individuals—an approach that has profound implications for advancing our understanding of both healthy brain function and neurological disorders.
This paper presents the materials presented as Educational Course ((https://griffithslab.github.io/OHBM-whole-brain-modelling-course/) during the Organization for Human Brain Mapping (OHBM) Annual Meeting 2023 in Montreal and serves a unique purpose—it not only delves into the theoretical underpinnings of Whole-Brain Modeling but also provides an unprecedented opportunity for hands-on exploration. Central to this endeavor is the innovative integration of theoretical concepts into tangible, practical applications. Embedded within this paper is a digital companion, a Jupyter notebook meticulously designed to transform abstract theories into interactive, visual representations. Through this digital companion, readers are empowered to engage with the theoretical concepts discussed in the paper in real-time, gaining practical insights into the complexities of whole-brain dynamics.
This unique approach serves as a bridge between theory and practice, enabling a seamless transition from abstract ideas to practical implementation. The Jupyter notebook presented here is not just a tool; it is a gateway, inviting readers to step into the realm of Whole-Brain Modeling, empowering them to explore, experiment, and understand the nuances of brain dynamics firsthand. Divided into three distinct sections—Background/Theory, Applications 1: Systems/Cognitive, and Applications 2: Clinicals—it provides participants with an immersive journey into this multidisciplinary realm. Importantly, each section is bolstered by practical implementations, realized through the use of Colab notebooks. These hands-on experiences empower participants to transform theoretical concepts into tangible, actionable insights.
This educational course is not just a tribute to WBM's progress; it is a key that unlocks a comprehensive understanding of a dynamic field—one that engages with its rich history, explores its current frontiers, and charts a course towards an inspiring future. It is an invitation to join us in unraveling the mysteries of the human brain, one connection at a time.
