### Abstract
<p style="text-align: justify;">
This paper presents an overview of an educational course run during the Organization for Human Brain Mapping (OHBM) Annual Meeting 2023 on whole-brain modeling, designed to provide a comprehensive introduction to the latest advancements in large-scale network modeling within the realm of contemporary human brain mapping research. Whole-Brain Modeling (WBM) is a scientific field with a short history and a long past, rooted in various disciplines and conceptual foundations dating back to as early as the 1940s. However, it wasn't until the late 2000s that WBM emerged in its current form, closely intertwined with macro-connectomics. During this period, seminal papers authored by influential theoretical and cognitive neuroscientists helped shape the landscape of WBM as it stands at the beginning of the 2020s. The course is structured into three main sections: Background/Theory, Applications 1: Systems/Cognitive, and Applications 2: Clinicals, with each offering valuable insights into the multidisciplinary field of whole-brain modeling. Practical implementations, facilitated through Colab notebooks, empower participants with hands-on experience in translating theoretical concepts into practice.
In addition to exploring the historical evolution of WBM, this paper also delves into its present state, highlighting notable successes, enduring challenges, and exciting future prospects. WBM has expanded in diverse methodological, theoretical, and clinical directions over the past decade, offering researchers a multitude of fascinating opportunities to advance our understanding of brain function and behavior.
This educational course not only serves as a showcase of WBM's progress but also equips learners with a holistic understanding of this dynamic field, enabling them to engage with its rich past, present developments, and promising future directions.
